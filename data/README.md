Here's some options for getting the bioisosteric replacements datasets: 

### The BoBER Dataset
This is the BoBER (Base of Bioisosteric Replacements) dataset. This dataset includes bioisosteres (different fragments that should have similar binding properties) that were detected by mining the Protein Data Bank using ProBiS algorithm. Two fragments are defined as bioisosteric if they were found to bind to structurally (geometrically & physicochemically) similar binding sites.

### ChEMBL + Processing
The code for processing data from the ChEMBL database is available at [Github](https://github.com/Hwoo-Kim/DeepBioisostere.git)


### SwissBioisostere
I don't think the databse is available other than the web portal
